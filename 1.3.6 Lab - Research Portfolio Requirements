Reflection Questions
Reflect upon the skills required by a data analyst role and consider what additional, or enhanced, skills that are required to develop the projects for your portfolio that interest you and where you see your data analyst career leading you.

Challenge Activities
The Square Kilometer Array (SKA) telescope project (https://www.skatelescope.org/the-ska-project/) and the James Webb Telescope (https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/webb/main/index.html) are very long-term astronomy projects that will produce almost unimaginable volumes of data over the lifetime of each project.

Think about the data skills that will have to be applied to analyze this data, and what processes may have to be developed to manage this analysis into the future.
